# Sudoku Solver with Parallel Programming Techniques

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a parallel Sudoku solver using OpenMP. The project explores three key parallelization techniques: **critical sections**, **atomic operations**, and **reduction**, to optimize the computational performance of solving Sudoku puzzles. 

## Features
- **Sequential Sudoku Solver**: Serves as the baseline for benchmarking and performance analysis.
- **Parallelized Sudoku Solver**: Incorporates advanced parallel programming techniques to reduce execution time and enhance scalability.
- **Performance Comparison**: Highlights the speedup and efficiency of parallelized code compared to the sequential version.

## Parallelization Techniques
1. **Critical Sections**:
   - Used to protect shared resources and ensure thread safety.
   - Ensures correctness when multiple threads access or modify shared variables.

2. **Atomic Operations**:
   - Reduces overhead by avoiding locking mechanisms for simple operations.
   - Ideal for lightweight synchronization of shared variables.

3. **Reduction**:
   - Optimizes operations like summation by combining intermediate results across threads.
   - Significantly improves performance for reduction-type problems.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with OpenMP support.
- A system with multiple cores to test parallel performance.

### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-parallel-solver.git
   cd sudoku-parallel-solver
